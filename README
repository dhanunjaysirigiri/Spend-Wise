This project entails the development of a robust expense tracking application utilizing the MERN 
Stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node.js). Commencing with backend establishment 
using Node.js and Express, integration with MongoDB database is achieved 
to ensure seamless data management. Transitioning to frontend development, ReactJS is 
employed to construct an intuitive and responsive user interface. Key functionalities encompass 
expense creation, management, and comprehensive analysis of expenditure trends over time. 
Through this project, participants will gain practical experience in full-stack development, 
mastering the intricacies of backend and frontend integration while implementing essential 
features to deliver a comprehensive expense tracking solution.
